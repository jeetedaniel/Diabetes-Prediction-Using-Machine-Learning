# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A classification based model to predict if a person is diabetic or not.
This model was done using Support Vector Machine Classifier
After a thorough analysis of the data it was found that the data was in a wide range and therefore had to be standardized using standard scaler
The accuracy was found to be arround 77 % on test data and 79% on train data
A predictive system was also done
